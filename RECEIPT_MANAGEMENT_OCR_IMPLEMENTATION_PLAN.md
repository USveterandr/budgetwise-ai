# Receipt Management with OCR Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the receipt management system with OCR capabilities in BudgetWise AI. The system needs to be implemented from scratch to meet all requirements in the Product Requirements Document.

## Current Status
The receipt management system is not yet implemented. The database schema exists with a receipts table, but no API endpoints or frontend components have been created. OCR functionality needs to be integrated.

## Database Schema Analysis
The existing receipts table schema includes:
- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- user_id (TEXT NOT NULL, foreign key to users)
- transaction_id (TEXT, foreign key to transactions)
- file_key (TEXT)
- file_url (TEXT)
- uploaded_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries to Implement
1. Create receipt: `INSERT INTO receipts (...) VALUES (...)`
2. Get user receipts: `SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE user_id = ?`
3. Update receipt: `UPDATE receipts SET ... WHERE id = ?`
4. Delete receipt: `DELETE FROM receipts WHERE id = ?`
5. Link receipt to transaction: `UPDATE receipts SET transaction_id = ? WHERE id = ?`

### API Endpoints to Implement
1. `POST /receipts/upload` - Upload a new receipt
2. `GET /receipts/user/{user_id}` - Get all receipts for a user
3. `GET /receipts/{id}` - Get a specific receipt
4. `DELETE /receipts/{id}` - Delete a receipt
5. `POST /receipts/{id}/process-ocr` - Process receipt with OCR
6. `POST /receipts/{id}/create-transaction` - Create transaction from receipt
7. `GET /receipts/analytics/spending-by-merchant` - Get spending by merchant data

### Frontend Components to Create
1. ReceiptDashboard - Main receipt overview page
2. ReceiptGrid - Grid display of receipt thumbnails
3. ReceiptUpload - Receipt upload form with drag-and-drop
4. ReceiptDetail - Detailed receipt view
5. ReceiptViewer - Receipt image viewer
6. OcrDataDisplay - Display of OCR extracted data
7. ReceiptAnalytics - Analytics dashboard component
