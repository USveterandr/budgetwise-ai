2. Implement Recharts for data visualization
3. Add filtering capabilities to all reports

### Phase 2: New Report Types
1. Implement budget performance reports
2. Create net worth calculation reports
3. Enhance investment performance reports

### Phase 3: Export Functionality
1. Implement PDF generation using a library like pdfmake or jsPDF
2. Add CSV export for all reports
3. Create export options in the UI

### Phase 4: Custom Report Builder
1. Design drag-and-drop interface
2. Implement report template system
3. Add scheduling capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend
