# Password Reset Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
The password reset feature has been successfully implemented to allow users to securely reset their passwords if they forget them. This feature includes a complete workflow from requesting a reset to setting a new password.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `password_reset_token` column to users table
- Added `password_reset_expires` column to users table
- Both columns are nullable to allow for users who haven't requested a reset

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- **POST /auth/forgot-password**: Request password reset
- **POST /auth/reset-password/verify**: Verify reset token
- **POST /auth/reset-password**: Reset password with token

### 3. Frontend Pages
- **Forgot Password Page**: `/auth/forgot-password`
- **Reset Password Page**: `/auth/reset-password`

### 4. Auth Library Functions
- `requestPasswordReset(email: string)`: Request password reset
- `verifyPasswordResetToken(token: string)`: Verify reset token
- `resetPassword(token: string, newPassword: string)`: Reset password

## Security Features

### Token Security
- Tokens are generated using `crypto.randomUUID()` for cryptographic security
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens are cleared from the database after successful password reset

### Password Security
- New passwords must meet the same strength requirements as signup
- Passwords are hashed using Web Crypto API SHA-256
- Old password hashes are replaced with new ones

### Privacy Protection
- System doesn't reveal if an email address exists in the database
- Same response is given for both existing and non-existing emails
- Tokens are single-use and expire after use

## User Experience

### Forgot Password Flow
1. User navigates to `/auth/forgot-password`
2. User enters their email address
3. System sends password reset email (if email exists)
4. User receives email with reset link
5. User clicks reset link to go to reset password page

### Reset Password Flow
1. User arrives at `/auth/reset-password` with token
2. System verifies token validity
3. User enters new password twice
4. System validates password strength
5. System updates password and clears reset token
6. User is redirected to login page

## Error Handling

### User-Friendly Messages
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Helpful guidance for password requirements
- Appropriate feedback for successful operations

### Security-Conscious Responses
- Generic responses for email verification to prevent user enumeration
- Specific error messages for expired or invalid tokens
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Password strength validation tests
- Auth function tests

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint tests
- Database operation tests

### End-to-End Tests
- User flow tests
- Error condition tests

## API Endpoints

### POST /auth/forgot-password
**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "If an account exists with that email, you will receive a password reset link shortly."
}
```

### POST /auth/reset-password/verify
**Request:**
```json
{
  "token": "reset-token-here"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Token is valid."
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid or expired reset token."
}
```

### POST /auth/reset-password
**Request:**
```json
{
  "token": "reset-token-here",
  "newPassword": "NewPassword123"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password reset successfully. You can now log in with your new password."
}
```

## Frontend Components

### Forgot Password Page
- Simple form with email input
- Clear instructions
- Link back to login page
- Proper error/success messaging

### Reset Password Page
- Token verification on page load
- Loading state while verifying token
- Error handling for invalid tokens
- Password strength requirements display
- Password confirmation field
- Success confirmation page

## Implementation Details

### Token Generation
- Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for secure token generation
- Tokens expire 1 hour after generation
- Tokens are stored in the database with expiration timestamp

### Password Handling
- New passwords validated against same rules as signup
- Passwords hashed using Web Crypto API SHA-256
- Old password hashes replaced with new ones
- Reset tokens cleared after successful reset

### Email Integration
- Uses existing HubSpot integration for sending emails
- Falls back to logging if HubSpot not configured
- Reset link includes token as URL parameter

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Backend endpoints implemented and deployed
- ✅ Frontend pages created
- ✅ Auth library functions implemented
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ End-to-end flow tested

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests
2. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Set up monitoring for password reset attempts
4. Create analytics dashboard for password reset metrics
