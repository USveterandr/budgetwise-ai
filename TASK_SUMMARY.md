## Task Management Approach

The task management system follows these principles:
1. **Granular Task Breakdown** - Large features are broken into smaller, manageable tasks
2. **Hierarchical Organization** - Related tasks are grouped under parent features
3. **Clear Status Tracking** - Each task has a clear status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE)
4. **Regular Updates** - Task statuses are updated as work progresses
5. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Plans and specifications are created for complex features

## Implementation Plans Created

Detailed implementation plans have been created for upcoming features:
1. `ADVANCED_REPORTING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive plan for advanced reporting features
2. `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan for notification system implementation

These plans provide technical specifications, implementation approaches, timelines, and testing strategies for each feature.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementation of Advanced Reporting features
2. Begin work on Notification System after completing Advanced Reporting
3. Create detailed plans for Phase 3 and Phase 4 as they approach
4. Regularly update task statuses to reflect current progress
