### 2. Custom Report Builder ✅ COMPLETED

#### Component Features
- **Field Configuration**
  - Add/remove report fields dynamically
  - Select data sources (transactions, budgets, investments, categories)
  - Choose field aggregations (sum, count, average, min, max)
  - Customize field display names

- **Visualization Options**
  - Table view for detailed data
  - Bar charts for comparisons
  - Line charts for trends
  - Pie charts for proportions

- **Filtering Capabilities**
  - Date range filtering
  - Category filtering
  - Account filtering (planned for future)

- **Template Management**
  - Save custom report templates
  - Local storage for template persistence
  - Report naming and descriptions

#### Technical Implementation
- Created reusable React component
- Implemented proper state management
- Added accessibility features
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Tab Navigation
- Added tabs to switch between predefined reports and custom builder
- Clean, intuitive interface design
- Consistent styling with existing application

#### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states for report generation
- Accessible form elements with proper labels

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/src/app/api/reports/generate/route.ts` - API endpoint for report generation
2. `/src/components/reports/CustomReportBuilder.tsx` - Custom report builder component

### Modified Files
1. `/src/app/reports/page.tsx` - Added PDF export functionality and custom report builder tab
2. `/package.json` - Added jsPDF and jspdf-autotable dependencies

## Libraries Used

1. **jsPDF** - For PDF generation
2. **jspdf-autotable** - For table formatting in PDFs
3. **Recharts** - Existing charting library (already in project)

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- ✅ PDF export for all report types
- ✅ Custom report builder field management
- ✅ Visualization type selection
- ✅ Template saving functionality
- ✅ Tab navigation between reports and builder

### Error Handling
- ✅ Network error handling for API calls
- ✅ Form validation for required fields
- ✅ Graceful degradation for missing data

## Future Enhancements

### PDF Export
1. **Advanced Formatting**
   - Custom headers/footers
   - Company branding options
   - Multiple paper size support

2. **Export Options**
   - Email delivery
   - Scheduled exports
   - Export history

### Custom Report Builder
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Report scheduling
   - Email notifications
   - Shared report templates

2. **Data Sources**
   - Account filtering
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Advanced date ranges

3. **Visualization**
   - More chart types
   - Custom color schemes
   - Interactive PDF exports

## Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data** - Currently using mock data instead of real database queries
2. **Local Storage** - Templates saved to localStorage instead of database
3. **Basic Filtering** - Limited filtering options compared to advanced analytics

### Planned Improvements
1. **Database Integration** - Connect to real data sources
2. **Template Management** - Server-side template storage
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Complex calculations and aggregations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ User authentication required for all report generation
- ✅ Input validation for all parameters
- ✅ Secure API endpoints with proper error handling

### Privacy
- ✅ No PII stored in reports without explicit user action
- ✅ User-controlled data export
- ✅ Secure local storage usage

## Performance

### Optimization
- ✅ Lazy loading for large reports
- ✅ Efficient data transformation
- ✅ Client-side caching for templates

### Scalability
- ✅ Modular component design
- ✅ Reusable utility functions
- ✅ Proper error boundaries
