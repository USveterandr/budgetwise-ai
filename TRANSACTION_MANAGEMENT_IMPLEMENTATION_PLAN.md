# Transaction Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the transaction management system in BudgetWise AI. The system is partially implemented with basic CRUD operations, but needs enhancement to meet all requirements in the Product Requirements Document.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add new fields to transactions table
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN merchant TEXT;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN tags TEXT;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN notes TEXT;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD';

-- Add indexes for improved performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_merchant ON transactions(merchant);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_tags ON transactions(tags);
```

### API Endpoints to Implement
1. `GET /transactions/search` - Search transactions by description
2. `GET /transactions/filter` - Filter transactions by various criteria
3. `POST /transactions/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple transactions
4. `POST /transactions/bulk-update` - Update multiple transactions
5. `GET /transactions/analytics/spending-by-category` - Spending by category report
6. `GET /transactions/analytics/monthly-summary` - Monthly spending summary

### Frontend Components to Create
1. TransactionSearch - Search and filter component
2. TransactionBulkActions - Bulk operation toolbar
3. TransactionDetail - Detailed transaction view
4. ReceiptPreview - Receipt thumbnail and preview component
5. TransactionAnalytics - Analytics dashboard component

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for transaction management code
- [ ] <500ms response time for transaction list API
- [ ] Support for 1000+ transactions per user
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for transaction endpoints
- [ ] <1% error rate in production

## Dependencies
- Receipt management system (for receipt linking)
- AI categorization service (for automatic categorization)
- Reporting system (for analytics endpoints)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance Issues**: Implement pagination and caching early
2. **Data Security**: Strict authorization checks on all endpoints
3. **User Experience**: Incremental rollout with user feedback
4. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling

This implementation plan builds on the existing transaction management foundation and adds the features needed to meet the requirements in the Product Requirements Document.
