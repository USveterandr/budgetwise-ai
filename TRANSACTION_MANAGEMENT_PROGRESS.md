## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model Updates
The transactions table has been updated to include:
- Merchant information for better categorization
- Tags for custom organization
- Notes for additional details
- Currency support for international users
- Transfer type for money movement between accounts

### API Endpoints Implemented
1. `GET /api/transactions` - List transactions with filtering
2. `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transaction
3. `GET /api/transactions/:id` - Get specific transaction
4. `PUT /api/transactions/:id` - Update transaction
5. `DELETE /api/transactions/:id` - Delete transaction
6. `POST /api/transactions/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple transactions
7. `POST /api/transactions/bulk-update` - Update multiple transactions
8. `GET /api/transactions/categories` - Get user's categories
9. `POST /api/transactions/categorize` - AI-powered categorization
10. `GET /api/transactions/stats` - Transaction statistics

### Frontend Components Created
1. TransactionList - Displays transactions in a table format
2. TransactionForm - Form for creating/editing transactions
3. TransactionSearch - Search and filter controls
4. TransactionBulkActions - Bulk operation controls
5. CategorySelector - Component for selecting/creating categories
6. TransactionDetail - Detailed view of a single transaction

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
