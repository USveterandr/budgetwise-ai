1. Implement advanced features (search, filtering, bulk operations)
2. Add AI categorization functionality
3. Create comprehensive frontend UI
4. Add integration tests
5. Conduct initial user testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model Updates
The transactions table has been updated to include:
- Merchant information for better categorization
- Tags for custom organization
- Notes for additional details
- Currency support for international users
- Transfer type for money movement between accounts

### API Endpoints to Implement
1. `GET /api/transactions` - List transactions with filtering
2. `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transaction
3. `GET /api/transactions/:id` - Get specific transaction
4. `PUT /api/transactions/:id` - Update transaction
5. `DELETE /api/transactions/:id` - Delete transaction
6. `POST /api/transactions/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple transactions
7. `POST /api/transactions/bulk-update` - Update multiple transactions
8. `GET /api/transactions/categories` - Get user's categories
9. `POST /api/transactions/categorize` - AI-powered categorization

### Frontend Components to Create
1. TransactionList - Displays transactions in a table format
2. TransactionForm - Form for creating/editing transactions
3. TransactionSearch - Search and filter controls
4. TransactionBulkActions - Bulk operation controls
5. CategorySelector - Component for selecting/creating categories
6. TransactionDetail - Detailed view of a single transaction

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Transaction CRUD operations
- Validation functions
- Category management
- Bulk operations

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- Database operations
- Authentication integration
- AI categorization

### End-to-End Tests
- Transaction creation flow
- Transaction editing flow
- Transaction deletion flow
- Bulk operations flow
- Search and filter functionality

## Challenges and Solutions

### Database Migration
**Challenge**: Updating existing schema while preserving data
**Solution**: Created migration script with ALTER TABLE commands and default values

### Data Validation
**Challenge**: Ensuring data integrity across all entry points
**Solution**: Implement comprehensive validation at both API and database levels

### User Experience
**Challenge**: Creating intuitive interface for transaction management
**Solution**: Follow established UI patterns and conduct user testing

## Success Criteria
- Users can create, read, update, and delete transactions
- Transactions are properly categorized
- Users can search and filter transactions
- Bulk operations work correctly
- AI categorization provides accurate suggestions
- System performs well under load
- All security measures are in place

## Timeline
- **October 24-31**: Core functionality implementation
- **November 1-7**: Advanced features and testing
- **November 8-14**: Bug fixes and optimization
- **November 15+**: User testing and feedback incorporation
