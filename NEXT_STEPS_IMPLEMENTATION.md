# BudgetWise AI - Next Steps Implementation Plan

Based on the Product Requirement Checklist and Implementation Roadmap, the next focus should be on completing the Transaction Management system.

## Current Status
- âœ… Authentication System (Completed)
- ðŸ”§ Transaction Management (In Progress)
- ðŸš€ Budget Management (Planned)
- ðŸš€ Investment Tracking (Planned)

## Week 2: Transaction Management Implementation

### Goals:
- Implement transaction CRUD operations
- Create transaction categorization system
- Build transaction listing and filtering
- Add bulk transaction operations

### Deliverables:
- Transaction management API endpoints
- Transaction listing UI
- Transaction form UI
- Category management system
- Search and filtering functionality

### Implementation Tasks:

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add transactions table to schema.sql
- [ ] Define transaction data model with fields:
  - id (UUID)
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - date (DATE)
  - description (TEXT)
  - category (TEXT)
  - amount (DECIMAL)
  - type (ENUM: income, expense, transfer)
  - receipt_url (TEXT, optional)
  - merchant (TEXT, optional)
  - tags (TEXT, optional)
  - notes (TEXT, optional)
  - currency (TEXT, default: USD)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

#### 2. API Endpoints Implementation
- [ ] GET /api/transactions - List transactions for user
- [ ] POST /api/transactions - Create new transaction
- [ ] PUT /api/transactions/:id - Update transaction
- [ ] DELETE /api/transactions/:id - Delete transaction
- [ ] GET /api/transactions/:id - Get specific transaction
- [ ] POST /api/transactions/bulk-delete - Delete multiple transactions
- [ ] POST /api/transactions/bulk-update - Update multiple transactions
- [ ] GET /api/transactions/categories - Get user's transaction categories
- [ ] POST /api/transactions/categorize - AI-powered categorization

#### 3. Database Worker Updates
- [ ] Add transaction-related functions to database-worker.js
- [ ] Implement transaction CRUD operations
- [ ] Add category management functions
- [ ] Implement bulk operations
- [ ] Add AI categorization endpoint

#### 4. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create Transactions page (/transactions)
- [ ] Implement transaction list view
- [ ] Create transaction form component
- [ ] Add search and filter functionality
- [ ] Implement bulk action controls
- [ ] Add category management UI
- [ ] Create transaction detail view

#### 5. AI Integration
- [ ] Implement basic transaction categorization
- [ ] Add merchant-based category suggestions
- [ ] Create category learning mechanism

#### 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for transaction operations
- [ ] Integration tests for transaction API
- [ ] End-to-end tests for transaction workflows
- [ ] Performance tests for transaction listing

### Priority Features for Implementation:

#### High Priority (Week 2):
1. Basic transaction CRUD operations
2. Transaction listing UI
3. Transaction form UI
4. Database schema implementation
5. API endpoints for core functionality

#### Medium Priority (Week 3):
1. Search and filtering functionality
2. Category management system
3. Bulk transaction operations
4. Receipt integration
5. Merchant identification

#### Long Term Goals:
1. AI-powered automatic categorization
2. Bank synchronization (Plaid integration)
3. Advanced reporting features
4. Transaction import/export
5. Recurring transaction support

### Technical Considerations:
- Ensure proper user isolation (users can only access their own transactions)
- Implement proper validation for transaction data
- Add pagination for transaction lists
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Maintain consistency with existing authentication patterns
- Follow responsive design principles for mobile compatibility

### Security Considerations:
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Sanitize data before database storage
- Protect against SQL injection
- Ensure secure API communication
- Implement rate limiting for transaction operations

This implementation plan aligns with the roadmap and will move the project from the Foundation phase to the Enhanced Functionality phase.
