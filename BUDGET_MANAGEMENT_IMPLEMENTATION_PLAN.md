# Budget Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the budget management system in BudgetWise AI. The system needs to be implemented from scratch to meet all requirements in the Product Requirements Document.

## Current Status
The budget management system is not yet implemented. The database schema exists with a budgets table, but no API endpoints or frontend components have been created.

## Database Schema Analysis
The existing budgets table schema includes:
- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- user_id (TEXT NOT NULL, foreign key to users)
- category (TEXT)
- limit_amount (REAL)
- spent_amount (REAL DEFAULT 0)
- start_date (TIMESTAMP)
- end_date (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries to Implement
1. Create budget: `INSERT INTO budgets (...) VALUES (...)`
2. Get user budgets: `SELECT * FROM budgets WHERE user_id = ?`
3. Update budget: `UPDATE budgets SET ... WHERE id = ?`
4. Delete budget: `DELETE FROM budgets WHERE id = ?`
5. Calculate spent amount: `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = ? AND category = ? AND date BETWEEN ? AND ?`

### API Endpoints to Implement
1. `POST /budgets` - Create a new budget
2. `GET /budgets/user/{user_id}` - Get all budgets for a user
3. `GET /budgets/{id}` - Get a specific budget
4. `PUT /budgets/{id}` - Update a budget
5. `DELETE /budgets/{id}` - Delete a budget
6. `GET /budgets/analytics/progress` - Get budget progress data
7. `GET /budgets/analytics/spending-trends` - Get spending trend data

### Frontend Components to Create
1. BudgetDashboard - Main budget overview page
2. BudgetCard - Individual budget display component
3. BudgetForm - Budget creation/editing form
4. BudgetDetail - Detailed budget view
5. BudgetProgress - Visual progress indicator
6. BudgetAlert - Budget alert notification
7. BudgetAnalytics - Analytics dashboard component

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for budget management code
- [ ] <500ms response time for budget list API
- [ ] Real-time budget updates
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for budget endpoints
- [ ] <1% error rate in production

## Dependencies
- Transaction management system (for spent amount calculation)
- Notification system (for budget alerts)
- Reporting system (for analytics)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance Issues**: Implement efficient database queries and caching
2. **Data Security**: Strict authorization checks on all endpoints
3. **User Experience**: Incremental rollout with user feedback
4. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
5. **Real-time Updates**: Efficient calculation algorithms to prevent performance issues

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for building a comprehensive budget management system that meets the requirements in the Product Requirements Document.
