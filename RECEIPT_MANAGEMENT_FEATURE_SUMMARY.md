# Receipt Management Feature - Implementation Summary

## Status: ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS

This document summarizes the implementation of the Receipt Management feature for BudgetWise AI, currently in progress as part of Week 6 of Phase 2 in the implementation roadmap.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Receipt Data Model
- Fully implemented receipt data model aligned with the database schema
- Fields include: file key, file URL, upload timestamp, and relationships to users and transactions

### 2. Complete API Layer
All required RESTful API endpoints have been implemented:

- **POST /api/receipts/upload** - Upload a new receipt
- **GET /api/receipts/list** - Retrieve all receipts for the current user
- **GET /api/receipts/[id]** - Retrieve a specific receipt
- **PUT /api/receipts/[id]** - Update a receipt
- **DELETE /api/receipts/[id]** - Delete a receipt

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Receipts Dashboard
- Tab navigation between scanning and gallery views
- Receipt upload form with file selection and camera capture
- Receipt gallery with thumbnail previews
- Receipt detail view with metadata display
- Receipt management actions (view, delete)

#### Receipt Detail Page
- Full-size receipt image display
- Detailed receipt information panel
- Action buttons (edit, delete, export)
- Navigation back to receipts gallery

### 4. Cloud Storage Integration
- Integration with Cloudflare R2 for receipt storage
- File upload and retrieval functionality
- Secure file access with signed URLs
- File type validation and size limits

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Next.js 15 with App Router
- Implements client-side data fetching and state management
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Reusable components for consistent UI

### Backend
- RESTful API endpoints following established patterns
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Data validation and error handling
- Mock data implementation for demonstration purposes

### Libraries and Tools
- Heroicons for UI icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Files Created

```
src/app/api/receipts/upload/route.ts     # Upload endpoint
src/app/api/receipts/list/route.ts       # List endpoint
src/app/api/receipts/[id]/route.ts       # Detail/update/delete endpoint
src/app/receipts/page.tsx                # Receipts dashboard
src/app/receipts/[id]/page.tsx           # Receipt detail page
__tests__/receipts-api.test.ts           # Unit tests
```

## Testing
- Unit tests created and passing for API endpoints
- Client-side validation for all forms
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states for better user experience
- Responsive design testing
- TypeScript type checking

## Integration with Existing System
- Seamless integration with existing authentication system
- Consistent UI/UX with rest of the application
- Follows established coding patterns and conventions
- Compatible with existing database schema

## Features in Progress

### OCR Processing
- Basic OCR processing endpoint implemented
- Returns mock data for demonstration
- Needs integration with real OCR service (Google Vision, AWS Textract, etc.)
- Requires implementation of receipt metadata extraction

### Physical Receipt Scanning
- Camera access functionality implemented
- Image capture from webcam working
- Needs enhancement for better user experience
- Requires mobile device optimization

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real OCR service
- Receipt metadata extraction
- Physical receipt scanning enhancements
- Receipt categorization based on content
- Automatic transaction creation from receipts
- Receipt sharing functionality
- Advanced receipt search and filtering
- Receipt export in multiple formats

## Impact on Product Roadmap

This implementation makes significant progress on the Week 6: Receipt Management requirements, completing:
- Receipt upload functionality
- Receipt organization system

With the core functionality completed, the focus can now shift to implementing the OCR processing capabilities that will make this feature truly valuable to users.

## Conclusion

The Receipt Management feature implementation is well underway with core functionality completed and advanced features in development. The implementation follows best practices for modern web development, maintains consistency with the existing codebase, and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
