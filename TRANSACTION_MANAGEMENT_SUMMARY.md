## Database Schema

### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('income','expense','transfer')) NOT NULL,
  receipt_url TEXT,
  merchant TEXT,
  tags TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### Categories Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('income','expense')),
  color TEXT,
  icon TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
