3. Set up email delivery infrastructure
4. Create basic notification service

### Phase 2: Email Notifications
1. Create email templates
2. Implement email sending functionality
3. Add notification triggers for key events
4. Test email delivery

### Phase 3: In-App Notifications
1. Implement real-time notification delivery
2. Create notification center UI
3. Add mark as read functionality
4. Implement notification filtering

### Phase 4: Settings and Scheduling
1. Create notification settings page
2. Implement user preference management
3. Add notification scheduling capabilities
4. Add delivery retry mechanisms
