# BudgetWise - Product Requirements Document

## Goal
Build a privacy-first, explainable personal finance app ("BudgetWise") that helps solopreneurs, business owners, and couples track spending, plan budgets, and save for major life goals (retirement, emergency fund, vacation, college, investments) â€” with bank statement import and exportable reports.

## Target Users
1. **Solopreneurs**: Track business + personal expenses separately; need tax-ready reports.
2. **Small Business Owners**: Monitor cash flow, categorize business vs. personal spend.
3. **Couples**: Shared budgeting, joint goal tracking, transparency without complexity.

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBDs)
- "Help me see where my money goes each month."
- "I want to save $X for retirement by Y without guessing."
- "Automatically categorize my bank transactions so I don't do it manually."
- "Show me if I'm on track for my vacation fund this quarter."
- "Export a clean spending report for my accountant."
