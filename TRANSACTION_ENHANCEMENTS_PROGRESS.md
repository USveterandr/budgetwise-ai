# Transaction Management Enhancements - Progress Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the transaction management enhancements for BudgetWise AI.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added new fields to transactions table:
  - `merchant` (TEXT)
  - `tags` (TEXT)
  - `notes` (TEXT)
  - `currency` (TEXT, default: 'USD')
- Created new `category_rules` table for automatic categorization
- Added necessary indexes for performance optimization

### 2. API Endpoints Implemented

#### Transaction Search and Filtering
- `GET /transactions/search` - Advanced search with filtering by description, date range, category, type, and amount

#### Bulk Operations
- `POST /transactions/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple transactions at once
- `POST /transactions/bulk-update` - Update multiple transactions at once

#### Analytics
- `GET /transactions/analytics/spending-by-category` - Spending analysis by category
- `GET /transactions/analytics/monthly-summary` - Monthly income/expense summary

#### Category Rules Management
- `GET /category-rules/user/{user_id}` - Get all category rules for a user
- `POST /category-rules` - Create a new category rule
- `PUT /category-rules/{rule_id}` - Update an existing category rule
- `DELETE /category-rules/{rule_id}` - Delete a category rule

#### Automatic Categorization
- `POST /transactions/categorize` - Get category suggestion for a transaction

### 3. Migration Script
Created [transaction-enhancements-migration.sql](transaction-enhancements-migration.sql) to update the database schema.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Search and Filtering
The search endpoint supports:
- Text search in description and category fields
- Date range filtering
- Category filtering
- Type filtering (income/expense)
- Amount range filtering
- Sorting by date, amount, description, or category
- Pagination support

### Automatic Categorization
The categorization system uses a two-tier approach:
1. User-defined category rules with regex pattern matching
2. Fallback to keyword-based categorization for common transaction types

### Bulk Operations
Bulk operations include proper validation to ensure users can only modify their own transactions, with support for:
- Bulk deletion with transaction count verification
- Bulk updates with field validation
- Error handling for partial failures

### Analytics
Analytics endpoints provide:
- Spending by category with percentage breakdown
- Monthly income/expense summaries with net calculations

## Frontend Components Needed

### 1. TransactionSearch Component
- Search input field
- Filter sidebar with date range, category, type, and amount filters
- Sorting controls
- Pagination component

### 2. TransactionBulkActions Component
- Bulk selection checkboxes
- Bulk action toolbar (delete, update category, etc.)
- Confirmation dialogs

### 3. CategoryRulesManager Component
- Interface for managing user-defined category rules
- Form for creating/editing rules
- List view of existing rules

### 4. TransactionAnalytics Component
- Spending by category visualization
- Monthly summary charts
- Export functionality

### 5. Enhanced TransactionForm Component
- Additional fields for merchant, tags, notes, and currency
- Category suggestion integration
- Receipt linking capability

## Testing Status
