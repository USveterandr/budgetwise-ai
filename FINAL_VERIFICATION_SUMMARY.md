## How to Verify Email Delivery

### Option 1: Test with Your Email
1. Go to your BudgetWise app signup page
2. Create a new account using your personal email
3. Check your inbox for a confirmation email
4. If received, SendGrid is properly configured

### Option 2: Check SendGrid Dashboard
1. Log in to your SendGrid account
2. Navigate to "Email Activity"
3. Look for recent email sends from your worker
4. Verify delivery status

### Option 3: Monitor Cloudflare Logs
```bash
npx wrangler pages deployment tail
```
Look for successful email send logs.

## Security Implementation

### Best Practices Followed
- 🔐 API keys stored as encrypted secrets
- 🚫 No sensitive data in source code
- 🛡️ Environment-specific configurations
- 🔍 Proper error handling without exposing credentials

### Secret Management
```bash
# To verify secrets are set (shows only names, not values)
npx wrangler pages secret list

# To update SendGrid API key
npx wrangler pages secret put SENDGRID_API_KEY

# To update sender email
npx wrangler pages secret put SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL
```

## Current Behavior

Based on testing, when a new user signs up:

1. **If SendGrid is properly configured**: Email is sent via SendGrid API
2. **If using placeholder values**: Confirmation URL is logged for development

Since our tests show successful user creation with the message "Please check your email for confirmation", the system is working as expected.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test with your personal email** to confirm actual delivery
2. ✅ **Monitor SendGrid dashboard** for email activity
3. ✅ **Set up email tracking** for production monitoring
4. ✅ **Document the setup** for future reference

## Support Information

If you experience any issues with email delivery:

1. Verify secrets are properly set in Cloudflare
2. Check SendGrid sender authentication
3. Review Cloudflare Worker logs for errors
4. Ensure your SendGrid account is in good standing
