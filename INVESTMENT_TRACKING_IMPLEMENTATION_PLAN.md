# Investment Tracking Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the investment tracking module in BudgetWise AI. The system needs to be implemented from scratch to meet all requirements in the Product Requirements Document.

## Current Status
The investment tracking module is not yet implemented. The database schema exists with an investments table, but no API endpoints or frontend components have been created.

## Database Schema Analysis
The existing investments table schema includes:
- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- user_id (TEXT NOT NULL, foreign key to users)
- asset_name (TEXT)
- symbol (TEXT)
- shares (REAL)
- purchase_price (REAL)
- current_price (REAL)
- value (REAL)
- profit_loss (REAL)
- purchase_date (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Queries to Implement
1. Create investment: `INSERT INTO investments (...) VALUES (...)`
2. Get user investments: `SELECT * FROM investments WHERE user_id = ?`
3. Update investment: `UPDATE investments SET ... WHERE id = ?`
4. Delete investment: `DELETE FROM investments WHERE id = ?`
5. Calculate portfolio value: `SELECT SUM(value) FROM investments WHERE user_id = ?`
6. Calculate asset allocation: `SELECT asset_name, SUM(value) FROM investments WHERE user_id = ? GROUP BY asset_name`

### API Endpoints to Implement
1. `POST /investments` - Create a new investment
2. `GET /investments/user/{user_id}` - Get all investments for a user
3. `GET /investments/{id}` - Get a specific investment
4. `PUT /investments/{id}` - Update an investment
5. `DELETE /investments/{id}` - Delete an investment
6. `GET /investments/analytics/portfolio-value` - Get portfolio value data
7. `GET /investments/analytics/asset-allocation` - Get asset allocation data
8. `GET /investments/analytics/performance` - Get performance data

### Frontend Components to Create
1. InvestmentDashboard - Main investment overview page
2. InvestmentCard - Individual investment display component
3. InvestmentForm - Investment creation/editing form
4. InvestmentDetail - Detailed investment view
5. PortfolioPerformance - Portfolio performance visualization
6. AssetAllocation - Asset allocation chart
7. InvestmentAnalytics - Analytics dashboard component

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for investment tracking code
- [ ] <500ms response time for investment list API
- [ ] Real-time investment updates
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for investment endpoints
- [ ] <1% error rate in production

## Dependencies
- Transaction management system (for investment transactions)
- Reporting system (for analytics)
- Market data API (for real-time prices - future feature)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance Issues**: Implement efficient database queries and caching
2. **Data Security**: Strict authorization checks on all endpoints
3. **User Experience**: Incremental rollout with user feedback
4. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
5. **Real-time Updates**: Efficient calculation algorithms to prevent performance issues
6. **Market Data Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms for when market data is unavailable

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for building a comprehensive investment tracking module that meets the requirements in the Product Requirements Document.
